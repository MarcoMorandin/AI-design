**Technical Summary: Stackelberg Game Optimization**

### Problem Statement

The problem is to optimize the offloading strategy of EUs (End-Users) and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in a given environment, subject to certain constraints and pricing schemes.

### Methodology

1.  **Definition of Nash Equilibrium**: The concept of Nash equilibrium was introduced by John Nash in 1950. It refers to a state where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.
2.  **Stackelberg Game**: A Stackelberg game is a type of cooperative game in which one player (the leader) sets a strategy that is better than what the other players can achieve if they follow each other's strategies directly, but worse than what they could have achieved if they were to wait and set their own strategy first.
3.  **Primal Offloading Strategy**: The primal offloading strategy of an EU is defined in terms of its threshold for the pricing scheme of the UAV controller server.

### Key Findings

*   **Optimal Pricing Strategy**: The optimal pricing strategy for the UAV controller server is found to be \(\lambda_{i}^{min}=\delta_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}-\frac{p_{i}}{r_{i,j}}\) and \(\lambda_{i}^{max}=2\delta_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}\).
*   **Nash Equilibrium**: A unique Stackelberg equilibrium is proposed between EUs and the UAV controller server, where the utility function of UAV controller adheres to Eq. (3).

### Technical Conclusions

The optimization problem can be solved using a combination of dynamic programming techniques and linear programming methods.

*   **Dynamic Programming**: The optimal offloading strategy for each EU can be obtained by recursively computing the maximum utility achievable by each EU given its current pricing strategy.
*   **Linear Programming**: The optimal prices for the UAV controller server can be found using linear programming techniques, which involve solving a set of linear equations to maximize the objective function.

### Code Implementation

The code implementation will utilize dynamic programming and linear programming methods to solve the optimization problem. The specific implementation details are not provided in this response as they would require additional context and technical expertise.

**Example:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Define parameters
p_i = 10.0  # Price of the resource for EU i
r_ij = 2.0  # Coefficient of the resource j in the pricing scheme for UAV controller server
delta_i = 5.0  # Threshold value for the pricing scheme of the UAV controller server

# Calculate optimal prices for UAV controller server
lambda_min = delta_i + p_i / r_ij
lambda_max = 2 * delta_i + p_i / r_ij

print("Optimal prices for UAV controller server:", lambda_min, "and", lambda_max)
```

Note: This is a simplified example and actual implementation would require more detailed information on the problem context.

**Technical Summary**

This paper presents a novel framework for optimizing UAV deployment and resource allocation in 3D corridors. The proposed system is based on a competitive game theory approach, where the UAV controller coordinates with damaged UEs to allocate computational resources.

**Methodology**

The system utilizes a Stackelberg game model, where the UAV controller acts as the "leader" and allocates resources to UEs in a sequential manner. The main objective of this framework is to achieve efficient resource allocation while minimizing conflict between the UAV controller and UEs.

**Key Findings**

*   The proposed ULAR (UAV-Located Alternating Resource) mechanism optimizes UAV placement and resource allocation for damaged UEs in disaster areas.
*   By utilizing a Stackelberg game model, the system achieves efficient resource allocation while minimizing conflict between the UAV controller and UEs.
*   The framework is based on a competitive relationship, where the UAV controller allocates resources to UEs based on their needs and capacities.

**Technical Conclusions**

The proposed ULAR mechanism provides a novel approach for optimizing UAV deployment and resource allocation in 3D corridors. By incorporating game theory concepts, the system achieves efficient resource allocation while minimizing conflict between the UAV controller and UEs. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive simulations, which show significant improvements in resource utilization and reduced conflicts.
