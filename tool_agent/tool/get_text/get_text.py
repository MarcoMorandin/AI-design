That’s a massive undertaking—50 000 words interwoven with mathematical (or scientific) formulas. Before diving in, could you help me narrow down the scope?

1. **Subject area and purpose**  
   - Is this a math textbook, physics monograph, engineering manual, or something else?  
   - Who’s the audience (e.g. undergraduates, researchers, general readers)?  

2. **Types of formulas**  
   - Purely symbolic math (algebra, calculus, proofs)?  
   - Applied formulas (physics equations, engineering schematics)?  
   - Chemical formulas or other domain-specific notation?  

3. **Structure and organization**  
   - Do you want chapters with specific topics?  
   - Rough outline or table of contents up front?  

4. **Level of rigor and exposition**  
   - Heavily proof-based, or more intuitive and example-driven?  

Once I know the domain, audience, and structure, I can draft a detailed outline and then begin churning out the sections (in manageable chunks) with the requisite formulas. Let me know!
Below is a compact, formula-dense exposition touching key pillars of (linear and abstract) algebra. Feel free to let me know if you’d like more depth on any topic or a longer treatment!

**1. Systems of Linear Equations**  
A system of \(m\) equations in \(n\) unknowns \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) can be written in matrix form as  
\[
A\,\mathbf x \;=\;\mathbf b,
\quad
A\in M_{m\times n}(K),\;
\mathbf x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)^T,\;
\mathbf b\in K^m.
\]  
The system is  
- **consistent** iff \(\mathrm{rank}(A)=\mathrm{rank}([A\mid \mathbf b])\).  
- **underdetermined** (infinitely many solutions) if \(\mathrm{rank}(A)<n\).  
- **overdetermined** (no solution or least‐squares) if \(\mathrm{rank}(A)=n\) but \(\mathbf b\notin\operatorname{Im}(A)\).  

General solution when \(\mathrm{rank}(A)=r<n\):
\[
\mathbf x = \mathbf x_p + \sum_{i=1}^{n-r} t_i\,\mathbf v_i,
\]
where \(\mathbf x_p\) is a particular solution and \(\{\mathbf v_i\}\) spans \(\ker A\).

**2. Matrices, Determinants, and Inverses**  
For \(A\in M_n(K)\), the determinant is  
\[
\det A \;=\;\sum_{\sigma\in S_n} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\,\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)}.
\]  
Key properties:  
\[
\det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B),\quad 
\det(A^T)=\det(A),\quad
\det(A^{-1})=\det(A)^{-1}.
\]  
Inverse (when \(\det A\neq0\)):
\[
A^{-1} = \frac1{\det A}\,\operatorname{adj}(A),
\quad
(\operatorname{adj}(A))_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}\det\big(A^{(j,i)}\big).
\]  

---

**3. Vector Spaces and Bases**  
A vector space \(V\) over a field \(K\) satisfies closure under addition and scalar multiplication. A subset \(\{v_1,\dots,v_k\}\subset V\) is a **basis** if it is linearly independent and spans \(V\):
\[
\alpha_1v_1 + \cdots + \alpha_kv_k = 0 \;\Longrightarrow\; \alpha_i=0,
\quad
\mathrm{span}\{v_i\}=V.
\]  
Dimension: \(\dim V = |\,\text{any basis}\,|\).  Coordinate map w.r.t. a basis \(B=(v_i)\):
\[
[v]_B = (c_1,\dots,c_n)^T,\quad v = \sum_i c_i v_i.
\]

---

**4. Linear Transformations and Change-of-Basis**  
A linear map \(T:V\to W\) between finite-dimensional spaces satisfies  
\[
T(\alpha u + \beta v) = \alpha T(u) + \beta T(v).
\]  
With respect to bases \(B=\{v_i\}\) of \(V\) and \(C=\{w_j\}\) of \(W\), its matrix \( [T]_{C,B} = (t_{ji}) \) is defined by  
\[
T(v_i) = \sum_{j} t_{ji}\,w_j.
\]  
Change-of-basis: if \(P\) transforms coordinates from basis \(B\) to \(B'\), then  
\[
[T]_{B'} = P^{-1}\,[T]_{B}\,P.
\]

---

**5. Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Diagonalization**  
For \(A\in M_n(K)\), \(\lambda\in K\) is an **eigenvalue** if  
\[
\exists\,v\neq0:\quad A v = \lambda v.
\]  
Characteristic polynomial:
\[
\chi_A(\lambda) = \det(A - \lambda I) = (-1)^n\lambda^n + c_{n-1}\lambda^{n-1} + \cdots + c_0.
\]  
Algebraic vs. geometric multiplicity:  
\[
\text{alg mult}(\lambda) = \text{ord of }\lambda\text{ in }\chi_A,
\quad
\text{geo mult}(\lambda) = \dim\ker(A-\lambda I).
\]  
Diagonalizable iff there are \(n\) linearly independent eigenvectors, equivalently the minimal polynomial splits into distinct linear factors.  If \(A = S D S^{-1}\) with \(D=\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)\), then
\[
A^k = S\,D^k\,S^{-1},\quad
\exp(A) = S\,\exp(D)\,S^{-1},\quad
\exp(D) = \operatorname{diag}(e^{\lambda_i}).
\]

---

**6. Polynomial Rings and Factorization**  
The ring of polynomials \(K[x]\) is a principal ideal domain (PID).  Every non-constant
\[
f(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0
\]
admits a unique (up to units) factorization
\[
f(x) = a_n \prod_{i=1}^r (x-\alpha_i)^{e_i}
\]
over an algebraic closure \(\overline K\).  In \(K[x]\) itself, one has
\[
f(x) = g(x)\,h(x)
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\gcd(g,h)=1 \text{ or nontrivial common factor}.
\]  
Euclidean algorithm for \(\gcd(f,g)\):
\[
f = q_1\,g + r_1,\quad
g = q_2\,r_1 + r_2,\;\dots,\;
r_{k-1} = q_{k+1}\,r_k + 0,
\]
then \(\gcd(f,g)=r_k\).

---

**7. Sylow Theorems (Group-Theory Glimpse)**  
Let \(G\) be a finite group, \(|G|=p^k m\) with \(\gcd(p,m)=1\). A **Sylow \(p\)-subgroup** is any subgroup of order \(p^k\). The Sylow theorems assert:  
1. Existence: \(\exists\,P\le G,\;|P|=p^k.\)  
2. Conjugacy: any two Sylow \(p\)-subgroups are conjugate in \(G\).  
3. Counting: if \(n_p\) is the number of Sylow \(p\)-subgroups, then  
\[
n_p \equiv 1\pmod p,
\quad
n_p \mid m.
\]
