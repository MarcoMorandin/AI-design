That’s a massive undertaking—50 000 words interwoven with mathematical (or scientific) formulas. Before diving in, could you help me narrow down the scope?

1. **Subject area and purpose**  
   - Is this a math textbook, physics monograph, engineering manual, or something else?  
   - Who’s the audience (e.g. undergraduates, researchers, general readers)?  

2. **Types of formulas**  
   - Purely symbolic math (algebra, calculus, proofs)?  
   - Applied formulas (physics equations, engineering schematics)?  
   - Chemical formulas or other domain-specific notation?  

3. **Structure and organization**  
   - Do you want chapters with specific topics?  
   - Rough outline or table of contents up front?  

4. **Level of rigor and exposition**  
   - Heavily proof-based, or more intuitive and example-driven?  

Once I know the domain, audience, and structure, I can draft a detailed outline and then begin churning out the sections (in manageable chunks) with the requisite formulas. Let me know!
Below is a compact, formula-dense exposition touching key pillars of (linear and abstract) algebra. Feel free to let me know if you’d like more depth on any topic or a longer treatment!

**1. Systems of Linear Equations**  
A system of \(m\) equations in \(n\) unknowns \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) can be written in matrix form as  
\[
A\,\mathbf x \;=\;\mathbf b,
\quad
A\in M_{m\times n}(K),\;
\mathbf x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)^T,\;
\mathbf b\in K^m.
\]  
The system is  
- **consistent** iff \(\mathrm{rank}(A)=\mathrm{rank}([A\mid \mathbf b])\).  
- **underdetermined** (infinitely many solutions) if \(\mathrm{rank}(A)<n\).  
- **overdetermined** (no solution or least‐squares) if \(\mathrm{rank}(A)=n\) but \(\mathbf b\notin\operatorname{Im}(A)\).  

General solution when \(\mathrm{rank}(A)=r<n\):
\[
\mathbf x = \mathbf x_p + \sum_{i=1}^{n-r} t_i\,\mathbf v_i,
\]
where \(\mathbf x_p\) is a particular solution and \(\{\mathbf v_i\}\) spans \(\ker A\).

**2. Matrices, Determinants, and Inverses**

**3. Vector Spaces and Bases**

**5. Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Diagonalization**

Each section above is intentionally formula-dense. Let me know if you’d like further expansions—proofs, more examples, problem sets, or deeper exploration of rings, fields, modules, homological algebra, etc.!
