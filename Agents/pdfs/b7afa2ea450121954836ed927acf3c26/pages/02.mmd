orridors [11, 12], and provide computing services for UEs in place of the Damaged BS-MEC that has lost communication and computing power. In order to achieve the efficient collaborative operation of UAVs and MEC, the UAV controller deploys UAV-MEC through the precise Remote ID communication technology. In detail, all \(J\) UAVs denoted as \(\mathcal{J}=\{1,2,\ldots,J\}\) are dispatched by the UAV controller. Further, \(I\) UEs are distributed in the disaster area denoted as \(\mathcal{I}=\{1,2,\ldots,I\}\), and the computation task generated by UE \(i\) is represented as a two-tuple, \(T_{i}=\{G_{i},g_{i}\}\). Wherein, \(G_{i}\) and \(g_{i}\) are the size of all data as well as the size of data offloaded to the UAV-MEC, respectively. Let \(\{p_{i},\varepsilon_{i}\}\) denote the local computing power and unit energy consumption of UE \(i\), respectively. The characteristics of UAV \(j\) are described as \(\{f_{j},P_{j}^{\mathrm{comp}}\}\), where \(f_{j}\) represents the total computation resources owned by UAV \(j\), and \(P_{j}^{\mathrm{comp}}\) represents the CPU power of the UAV-MEC server.

The 3D Cartesian coordinates are utilized to represent the positions of UAVs and UEs. The location of UAV \(j\) and UE \(i\) are denoted as \(z_{j}=(x_{j},y_{j},h_{j})\) and \(z_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i},0)\), respectively. Thus, the distance between UAV \(j\) and UE \(i\) is calculated as \(d_{i,j}=\sqrt{\left\|z_{i}-z_{j}\right\|^{2}}\).

### _Communication Model_

Considering that the UAVs are deployed in the 3D corridors with a constant height of \(H\), we assume that the task offloading link between UEs and UAVs can be modeled as a line-of-sight (LoS). The uplink model from UE \(i\) to UAV \(j\) is expressed as:

\[r_{i,j}=B\log_{2}\left(1+\frac{q_{i}h_{i,j}}{\sigma^{2}}\right), \tag{1}\]

where \(B\) is the bandwidth allocated by UE \(i\) to UAV \(j\), \(\sigma^{2}\) represents the noise power and \(q_{i}\) is the transmission power of UE \(i\). The channel gain can be expressed as \(h_{i,j}=d_{i,j}^{-p}\), where \(\rho\) denotes the path loss factor between UEs and UAVs.

### _Utility of UE and UAV Controller_

#### Ii-C1 Utility of UE

The uplink transmission time from UE \(i\) to UAV \(j\) can be calculated as \(t_{i,j}^{\mathrm{trans}}=\frac{q_{i}}{r_{i,j}}\). Then, the uplink transmission energy is \(E_{i,j}^{\mathrm{trans}}=p_{i}t_{i,j}^{\mathrm{trans}}\). The local computation energy consumption of UE \(i\) is \(E_{\mathrm{local}}^{\mathrm{comp}}=\varepsilon_{i}(G_{i}-g_{i})\). Therefore, the utility of UE \(i\) is

\[U_{i}=S(g_{i})\delta_{i}-E_{i,j}^{\mathrm{trans}}-E_{\mathrm{local}}^{\mathrm{ comp}}-\lambda_{i}g_{i}, \tag{2}\]

where \(S(g_{i})=\ln(1+g_{i})\) is the satisfaction function that reflects the satisfaction degree of UE. \(\delta_{i}\) is the control coefficient to assess the impact of UE satisfaction on its utility. \(\lambda_{i}\) represents the price of each unit of data offloaded by the UAV-MEC server for each UE.

#### Ii-C2 Utility of UAV Controller

In face of simultaneous offloading of multiple UEs, the UAV-MEC server adopts an equal allocation strategy of computing power [13]. We assume that there are \(M_{j}\) UEs offloading tasks to the UAV \(j\) simultaneously. The computing time of UAV \(j\) for the offloading data of UE \(i\) can be calculated as \(t_{i,j}^{\mathrm{comp}}=\frac{\alpha g_{i}}{f_{ij}}\), where \(f_{ij}=f_{j}/M_{j}\) represents UE \(i\) obtains the computing resource from UAV \(j\), and \(\alpha\) is a coefficient related to data encoding.

Therefore, the computing energy consumption of UAV-MEC server \(j\) for UE \(i\) is \(E_{i,j}^{\mathrm{comp}}=P_{j}^{\mathrm{comp}}t_{i,j}^{\mathrm{comp}}\). The energy consumption equation of UAV \(j\) is \(E_{j}^{\mathrm{comp}}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i,j}E_{i,j}^{\mathrm{comp}}\), where variable \(X_{i,j}\in\{0,1\}\) represents the link status between UE \(i\) and UAV \(j\). When \(X_{i,j}=1\), it indicates that UE \(i\) has establishes a connection with UAV \(j\), enabling the allocation of computing resources. Conversely, \(X_{i,j}=0\) means there exists no connection between UE \(i\) and UAV \(j\). The hovering energy consumption is denoted by \(E_{j}^{\mathrm{hov}}=P_{j}^{\mathrm{hov}}/\eta\), where \(P_{j}^{\mathrm{hov}}\) indicates the minimum power for hovering, and \(\eta\) represents the power efficiency [14]. Therefore, the utility of the UAV controller can be calculated as

\[U_{con}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}g_{i}-\sum_{j=1}^{J}E_{j}^{\mathrm{comp}}- \sum_{j=1}^{J}E_{j}^{\mathrm{hov}}. \tag{3}\]

### _Problem Formulation_

The optimization goal is to maximize the utility of both the UAV controller and UEs. The optimization problem for UE \(i\) is

\[\mathbf{P0}\text{:}\underset{g_{i},\lambda_{i},X_{i,j}}{\text{ max}}\quad U_{i},\] \[\text{s.t.}\ \sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}}X_{i,j}\leq 1,\forall i\in \mathcal{N}, \tag{4}\] \[g_{i}\in[0,G_{i}],\forall g_{i}\in\mathbf{g},\] (5) \[\lambda_{i}\in[\lambda_{i}^{min},\lambda_{i}^{max}],\forall \lambda_{i}\in\mathbf{\lambda},\] (6) \[X_{i,j}\in\{0,1\},\forall i\in\mathcal{N},\forall j\in\mathcal{ J}, \tag{7}\]

where constraint (4) denotes that UE \(i\) can only select one UAV from set \(\mathcal{J}\) to offload tasks. Constraint (5) indicates that the data amount of tasks offloaded by UE \(i\) is no more than the data amount of the entire task \(T_{i}\). Constraint (6) indicates the resource price range of the UAV controller, where \(\lambda_{i}^{min}\) and \(\lambda_{i}^{max}\) are the minimum and maximum prices, respectively. Constraint (7) indicates that UE \(i\) has the option to decide whether or not to offload the task to UAV \(j\).
